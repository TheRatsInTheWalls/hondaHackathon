Repo for Honda Hackathon

This is the final project that my team and I submitted to the first AutoMobility LA Hackathon (November 26-27, 2017).  
It's an app that connects users into a network of people interested in various activities (mostly directed at tourists). 
The app then suggests itineraries that spread users out, limiting traphic and increasing enjoyment.
